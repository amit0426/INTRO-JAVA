Q1) Write the difference between JRE, JDK and JVM?

JRE MEAN - JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT--(JVM + PREDEFINED LIBRARY CLASSES)
JDK MEAN - JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT----(JRE + DEVELOPMENT TOOLS LIKE JAVA COMPILER, DEBUGGER,ETC)
JVM MEAN - JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE

JRE - it is use of implementation in jvm designed to execute java programs.
provide programming tools and deployment technologies.
JDK - it is use to develop java applications.
JVM - it convert bytcode to machine specific code it is platform dependent 
necessary in both jdk and jre.




Q2)Write the difference between JSE, JEE and JME?
JSE- JAVA STANDARD EDITION -> You can develop standlone application/desktop.
applications or even write scripts using selenium tool for automation testing.


JEE - JAVA ENTERPRISE EDITION -> it's used to develop rich enterprise web applicattions.

JME - JAVA MICRO EDITION -> can be used to develop applications runing on mobile devices embedded systems etc.



Q3) How does java achieve platform independency?
java is platform independent because it does not depend on any type of plaform 
javva is platform - independent language . in java programs are compiled into bytecode code and that byte code is 
platform independent.




Q4) What are features of Java and explain them?

SIMPLE- object-oriented, simple syntax , write maintable code;

PORTABLE -  platform independent complite into bytecode and bytecode convert into machine specific language;

Secured ,ROBUST,ARCHITECTURE NEUTRAL , INTERPRETED , HIGH PERFORMANCE, MULTITHREADED,
DISTRIBUTED, DYNAMIC;
